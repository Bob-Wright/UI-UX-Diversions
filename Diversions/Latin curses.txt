futue — if you’re telling someone to “fuck off”. “fututus“ means "having been fucked”

irrumabo  — does not mean dick. In fact, it means, “I will make you suck my dick”, so at least dicks were involved.

trude id sursum tuum cunnum, faexnigre — Points for creativity on this one. Wow.

ede faece/faeces — faex is third declension. “Faeces” if you’re talking about lots of shit.

morde meos globos — yep.

irrumator — technically means: “one who forces others to suck dick”. Guys. I have a degree in this language.

Me irruma et te pedicabo — I don’t think “irrumare” takes the dative case, but I’m not %100 on that.

Es scortum obscenum vilis — “scortum” (whore) is neuter… ironically.

Bibe semen meum e poculo — a “baculus“ is a staff. I suppose that still works, though not in the way you meant.

Perite — technically, it means “go die”. Wow, mean.

Tu scortum es — I have no idea what “scronium” means, but I know “scortum” means whore.

Matris fututor — I’m assuming.

Te odeo, interfice te cochleari — “cochleare” is a third declension i-stem. I like this one, though. I might use this.

Matris Prolapsus — …not sure what you’re trying to say, here, but that does not mean “bitch”.

Estne volumen in toga, an solum tibi libet me videre — I have no corrections. I’m just laughing.

Fabricate diem, punk — with the obvious note that “punk” is not Latin.

Qualem mulierculam — “i” before “e”. 🙂

Viri sunt viri — literally, “men are men”. That men are slime is implied.

Hic erit in lecto fortissimus — literally, “he will be the mightiest in bed”.

(Hic) in lecto Hercules est — if you want to say “he is Hercules in bed”

In lecto fortissimus sum (OR) In lecto Hercules sum — if you want to say “I am the greatest in bed” or “I am Hercules in bed”. What you have makes no grammatical sense. Is this a quote that’s been cut off?

    *filius canis is fine for talking about a “son of a bitch”, but if you’re calling someone a son of a bitch, you’ll want to use the vocative: fili canis
